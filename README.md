# formity

Build dynamic React forms, without the hassle.

## Overview

Creating a multi-step form like [this](https://formity-example.vercel.app) in which there are questions dependent on previous answers can be a tedious and cumbersome task. Additionally, the challenges intensify when considering the need to store, share, or save such forms in a file or a database.

This is where Formity comes in, a solution designed to simplify the process. With Formity, building advanced multi-step forms is as straightforward as using a JSON. Say goodbye to complexities and experience form development like never before.

## Dependencies

Formity depends on two packages, [Mongu](https://mongu-docs.vercel.app) and [React Hook Form](https://www.react-hook-form.com). We suggest you to be at least a little familiar with these packages before using Formity.

## Installation

To install this package you have to run the following command.

```shell
npm install formity
```
